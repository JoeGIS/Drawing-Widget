## Quickstart
```javascript
// This sample code is setup to have the Drawing widget contained in a Dojo FloatingPane.  The widget is selects the Point drawing tool when it is opened, and clears the active drawing tools when it is hidden.
// Drawing widget requires the map to be loaded
on(mainMap, "load", function() {
    // Drawing widget
    var drawing = new Drawing({
        map: mainMap
        }, "DrawingWindow");
    drawing.startup();
    
    // When the DrawingWindow is shown
    on(buttonController, "showDrawingWindow", function()
    {
        drawing.changeDrawingTool("drawPoint");
    });
    
    // When the DrawingWindow is hidden
    on(buttonController, "hideDrawingWindow", function()
    {
        drawing.clearDrawingTool();
    });
});
```

## Requirements

    // The locationPath logic below may look confusing but all its doing is
    // enabling us to load the api from a CDN and load local modules from the correct location.
    packages: [{
        name: "application",
        location: package_path + '/js'
    }]
